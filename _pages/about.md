## News
- Our paper, Why the Proof Fails in Different Versions of Theorem Provers: An Empirical Study of Compatibility Issues in Isabelle, is accepted in FSE 2025. Congratulations to Xiaokun!
- (12/2024) I passed my PhD oral defense and finalized my thesis: [Trustworthy Program Generation](https://caiyufan-nus.github.io/files/thesis.pdf). 
- (11/2024) Our paper [Automated Program Refinement: Guide and Verify Code Large Language Model with Refinement Calculus](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3704905) was accepted in POPL 2025! 

## About Me
* My current research interest is program language and software engineering. I also research large language models (LLM) and trustworthy and verified LLM agents with formal methods. 
* I was a PhD student at the National University of Singapore under [ISEP](https://isep.nus.edu.sg/) program starting in August 2020. I got the President's Graduate Fellowship ([PGF](https://nusgs.nus.edu.sg/scholarships/presidents-graduate-fellowship)). 
* My PhD supervisor is Prof [Dong Jin Song](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~dongjs/).
* I graduated from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/index.aspx) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) in June 2020. I am a member of [IEEE honor class](http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/info/8338.htm).
* I also cooperated with Prof [David San√°n](https://davidsanan.github.io/), [Hou Zhe](https://zhehou.github.io/), [Lin Yun](http://linyun.info/), [Sun Jun](https://sunjun.site/research/) and [Liu Yang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/).
